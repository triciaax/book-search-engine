# Book Search Engine 

## Description
This application is a search engine that helps users find books and save them for future reference. This application uses a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. 

## How to use this application
Users must create an account or login in order to save their searched books. Click "Login/Sign Up" on the upper right of the screen.

All users can search books regardless if they are logged in, but in order to save a specific book users need to have an account and be successfully logged in.
